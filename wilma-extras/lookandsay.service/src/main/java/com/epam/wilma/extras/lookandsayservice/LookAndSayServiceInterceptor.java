/**
 * This example service has nothing to do with the messages, just presents how a funny service can be implemented.
 * In order to use/load it by Wilma, one of the interceptors must be implemented too (in or case the request interceptor).
 *
 * In order to understand, what this service does, have a look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA
 * Two parameters can be specified via query string,
 * "number" that the service will look, and "iterations" that will specify how many times the service will 'look-and-say'
 * before providing the result.
 * There are some limitations however
 * - "number" should be a positive integer number, and this parameter is mandatory
 * - "iterations" should be a positive integer number - it is optional, if not specified, or wrong value is give, "1" will be used
 * - the service will guess the length of the result, and if that is too long (i.e. probably longer than a billion characters),
 * it will refuse generating the answer.
 * Have fun!
