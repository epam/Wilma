                    <h1>Wilma Feature List</h1>
                </div>

                <h2>Wilma Operation Modes</h2>
                <p>Wilma can act as pure Proxy, can act as pure Service Stub, and can act in mixed mode (use both Proxy and Service Stub features).
                    See details about it <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Operation-Modes">here...</a>.
                </p><p>
                    For individual messages, it is also possible to enforce Wilma to ignore the stub settings and enforce working in proxy mode.
                </p>

                <h2>Stub - Configuration</h2>
                <p>The Stub part of Wilma is configured via JSON file(s). Details about how the Stub Configuration should be used can be found <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration">here...</a>.</p>
                <p>Wilma can handle multiple stub configurations. With this feature grouping of stub functions (by team, by stubbed application, by individual services, etc.) can be used.
                    See details about this possibility <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Multi-Stub-Configuration">here...</a>.</p>
                <p>The schema of the stub configuration JSON that is used by Wilma can be accessed at the following address:</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/blob/master/wilma-application/modules/wilma-stub-configuration-parser/src/main/resources/StubConfig.json">StubConfigSchema.json</a>
                </p>

                <h2>Stub - Condition Checkers</h2>
                <p>The stub configuration contains several <b>dialog-descriptors</b> that describes a stub request-response pair.
                    These pairs have a <b>condition-descriptor</b> and a <b>template-descriptor</b>, and the first may contain several <b>Condition Checkers</b>,
                    those evaluate the request and help identifying the ones where stub response should be generated (based on the template-descriptor).
                <p></p>
                    Among the numerous built-in <b>Condition Checkers</b>, you may write and use your own solutions too.
                </p>
                <p>See details on <b>Condition Checkers</b> <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration">here</a>, at "<i>Element: <b>condition</b></i>" section.</p>
                <p>See details on the <b>built-in Condition Checker classes</b> <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration,-Condition-Checkers">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Stub - Templates</h2>
                <p>When a stub response should be generated, it is easy to use a previously saved response template, and send it back.
                    Such templates can be plain text, xml, json, or anything else you need.</p>
                <p>To get more information on how templates are handled by Wilma, search for information <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration">here</a>, at "<i>Object: <b>template</b></i>" section.</p>


                <h2>Stub - Template Formatter Classes</h2>
                <p>In many cases the predefined response templates cannot be used as they are, but the response should be formed
                    - fields should be changed, time stamps should be updated, and so on. To address this Wilma offers built-in template formatters,
                    however it is possible for you to write and use your own template formatter classes.
                <p></p>
                It is also possible to call several template formatters before the stub response is finally sent back as answer.</p>
                <p>See details on template formatters <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration">here</a>, at "<i>Element: <b>response-descriptor</b></i>" section.</p>
                <p>See details on the <b>built-in Template Formatter classes</b> <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration,-Template-Formatters">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Using Interceptor classes</h2>
                <p>Interceptors are classes those intercept either request or response (or both) messages, and do whatever they would like to do with the intercepted messages.
                    You may write and use your own interceptor classes. See more details on interceptors <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration,-Interceptors">here...</a> </p>

                <h2>Using Message Sequences</h2>
                Sometimes it is necessary to know not just the last request to form a stub response, but previous messages content should be known as well (like messages connected together in a session).
                Wilma offers Sequence handling feature to address this problem, with this feature it is possible to collect and group request-response pairs into Sequences, and use such sequence to generate the stub response - as necessary.
                meanwhile there are some built-in sequence handles, you may write your own class, therefore collect request-response pairs as you need.
                <p></p>
                <p>See details on this feature <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Sequence-Handling">here...</a> </p>

                <h2>Configuring Wilma at run time - via UI</h2>
                <p>Wilma has a home page, where basic configurations can be made at run time.
                    You can reach the home page under the following URL after Wilma has started: <strong>http://<em>wilma-url</em>:<em>internal-port</em>/index</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            <em>wilma-url </em>
                        </strong>is the address of the server where Wilma is running.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            <em>internal-port</em>
                        </strong> is the port of the internal web server in Wilma that is configured in <code>wilma.conf.properties </code>(default
                        is <strong>
                        <em>1234</em>
                    </strong>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b>Wilma home page</b> currently contains two configuration groups: <b>Message Logging</b> and <b>Operation Mode</b> switches. <p/>
                Regarding <b>Message Logging</b>, it can be turned on and off. By turning Message Logging on, every HTTP/S request and response that goes through Wilma will be logged.<p/>
                Regarding <b>Operation Mode</b>, you can influence the major behavior of Wilma:
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li><b>Switch between modes</b>: can be switched between WILMA, PROXY and STUB modes. See more <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Operation-Modes">here...</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Interceptor usage</b>: enabling/disabling message interceptors. See more <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration,-Interceptors">here...</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Localhost blocking</b>: enabling/disabling Localhost blocking feature, see more <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Localhost-Blocking">here...</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Sequence handling</b>: enabling/disabling the build-in Message Sequence handling. See more <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Sequence-Handling">here...</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Note: <b>Switch changes has immediate affect on Wilma operation!</b></p>
                <p>Note2: There is an additional switch: <b>Message Marking</b>, that is not exposed onto the UI, but available by using direct url.</p>

                <p>Configuring switches via direct url:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>Get status of message logging: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/public/logging/status</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Turn ON message logging: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/logging/on</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Turn OFF message logging: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/logging/off</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Get status of operation mode: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/public/switch/status</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Set operation mode: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/switch/[MODE]</pre> where MODE can be
                        wilma, stub and proxy.<p/>
                    </li>
                    <li>Get status of message marking: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/public/messagemarking/status</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Turn ON message marking: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/messagemarking/on</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Turn OFF message marking: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/messagemarking/off</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Configuring Wilma at run time - via Java Service Library</h2>
                <p>Since Wilma version 1.5, <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Service-API-library-for-Java">Wilma Java Service Library</a> have the feature of configuring the stub part programmatically. See details <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Stub-Configuration,-via-API">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Uploading External Resources</h2>
                <p>There are four kinds of external resources those can be uploaded to Wilma, and each use different addresses for the upload.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>condition checkers:</b><br/>An external condition checker class can be uploaded to the following
                        url, with a file name parameter: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/stub/conditionchecker</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>templates</b><br/>A response template can be uploaded to the following url, with a file name parameter: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/stub/templates</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>template formatters</b><br/>
                        A template formatter can be uploaded to the following url, with a file name parameter: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/stub/templateformatter</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>stub configuration</b><br/>A new stub configuration can be uploaded to the following url, with a file name parameter: <pre>http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/stub/stubconfig</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                By using the `curl` command, this can be done in the following way: <pre># this example uploads 'ExternalConditionChecker.class'
# the class should be in the folder the command is executed.
# don't forget the fileName parameter at the end of the command!
curl -X POST --data-binary @ExternalConditionChecker.class http://wilma-url:internal-port/config/admin/stub/conditionchecker?fileName=ExternalConditionChecker.class</pre>
                <p><b>Note:</b> If the file name is not provided as parameter in the url,
                    the file will not be uploaded successfully.</p>

                <p>Wilma also has a UI page (the /stubconfig), where the list of dialog descriptors of the actual stub
                    configuration, the uploaded interceptors, condition checkers, template formatters, templates, sequence handler and jars
                    are visible, can be viewed and downloaded. New files can uploaded here as well, such as a new stub configuration and new resources.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting the Message Logs</h2>
                <p>There is a /messages page on Wilma UI, where configuration regarding the message logging can be viewed. Also the
                    message log files can be downloaded from here. Their content can be viewed online by clicking on the '[Source]' link next to the message file.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> If you need more sophisticated message search functionality, there is a lucene index based
                    search engine solution, that is the <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Message-Search-Application">Wilma Message Search application</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting the Wilma Application Logs</h2>
                <p>The Wilma application log files can be accessed at the page /logs via UI. Their source can be also viewed
                    online by clicking on the '[Source]' link next to the file name.</p>

                <p>The level of application logging can be configured from the logback.xml. By default it is set to INFO
                    level. For DEBUG level information the following configuration should be changed from INFO to DEBUG:</p>
                <pre>&lt;root level="INFO"&gt;
   &lt;appender-ref ref="${logger:-EMPTY}"/&gt;
   &lt;appender-ref ref="FILE-APP"/&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
                </pre>

                <h2>Blocking messages arrived from Localhost</h2>
                <p>In certain cases, when a remotely deployed Wilma application is in use, and the original target of the request is "localhost"
                    - as Wilma hosted on another machine from where the request is coming -
                    Wilma is unable to determine the real target host.
                    In this case forwarding to "localhost" would not have meaning,
                    and it is unknown where the request should be forwarded exactly.
                    To avoid such bad environment setup, it is possible to ask Wilma not to handle requests coming from localhost.
                <p></p>
                In case the localhost blocking functionality is enabled, it stops proxied requests directed to 127.0.0.1 or localhost. If it is disabled, no such restriction applied.</p>
                <p>See details on this feature <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Localhost-Blocking">here...</a> </p>

                <h2>Stability Rules</h2>
                <p>Wilma is designed to protect itself in case of huge load.
                    Therefore  - like if decoding the messages or saving it on the disk would take too much time, and the internal queries are getting full, -
                    Wilma (on-the-fly) configures itself to turn off time consuming operations, as the load increases,
                    first turns off decoding FIS-coded messages, and if the load is still high, it turns off saving messages to the disk. As soon as the load goes back to normal,
                    Wilma turns back the message logging, and later the FIS decoding too. See the <b>wilma.config.properties file</b> for setting the limits (search for <i>safeguard.*</i> properties).
                </p>

                <h2>Maintaining Message Logs</h2>
                <p>Wilma is designed to clean-up the old messages from the disk. A dedicated regular thread within Wilma checks the old messages, and delete them. This ensures that you can avoid disk full problems.
                    How to set how old messages should be deleted? Look for such info (see <i>log.maintainer.*</i> properties) in <b>wilma.config.properties file</b>.
                </p>

                <h2>Load Information</h2>
                <p>Both of the applications (Wilma and Wilma Message Search) provide data about their actual load and other information.
                    These data are available on both UIs.</p>
                <p>Get more information on the load data provided by the applications <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Load-Information">here...</a> </p>

                <h2>Java and .NET Service Libraries for Wilma</h2>
                <p>Wilma has service libraries in order to ease the communication/configuration of Wilma from your own code.</p>
                <p><b>Java Service Library for Wilma</b> is available via <b>JCenter</b>. See more info <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Service-API-library-for-Java">here...</a> </p>
                <p><b>.NET Service Library for Wilma</b> is available via <b>NuGet</b>. See more info <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Wilma-Service-API-library-for-.NET">here...</a> </p>

                <h2>Wilma Service Endpoint Extension possibility</h2>
                <p>Since Wilma version 1.5, by implementing ExternalWilmaService interface, it is <b>possible to communicate with your external plugins directly by using HTTP/REST calls</b>.
                    See details <a href="https://github.com/epam/Wilma/wiki/Service-Endpoint-Extensions-in-Plugins">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Shutting down Wilma and Wilma Message Search applications</h2>
                <p>You can shutdown Wilma application by sending a GET/POST request to the '/config/admin/shutdown' URL.</p>
                <p>You can shutdown Wilma Message Search application by sending a GET/POST request to the '/shutdown' URL.</p>
                <p>Both cases, killing the application JVM works too ;)</p>
