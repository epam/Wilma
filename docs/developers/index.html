                <p>The development of Wilma was started in the summer of 2013.
                </p><p>
                At the end of that year V0.6 become available. It was a fully functional transparent proxy and service stub.
                </p><p>
                    In 2014, the following enhancements were added/implemented: interceptors, jar upload handling, wilma-message search enhancements, and V0.7 was created.
            </p><p>
                    In Jan 2015, some further enhancements were added: message sequence handling, moving from maven to gradle build, internal load measurements, and V0.8 was created.
            </p><p>
                    In 2015, Wilma V1.0 was created, and it is opened for public use.
